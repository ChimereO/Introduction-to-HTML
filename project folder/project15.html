    <h5>Chess is definitely one of the most challenging and intellectually stimulating hobbies out there. Life is nothing but a
    great game of chess, and every person we encounter is a piece on the board.Chess is in certain ways more than just a game. You can learn about yourself and how you handle adversity, how to think
    in long term goals, or when to switch into immediate mode based on what is happening in a game. There is a beauty to the
    game and symmetry that other games lack.</h5>

        <h5>Reading helps you explore life from different perspectives. While you read books you are building new and creative
        thoughts, images and opinions in your mind. It makes you think creatively, fantasize and use your imagination. Develops
        your Analytical Skills: By active reading, you explore several aspects of life. <br>Reading is a pleasure, reading is a challenge, and reading is a choice. Whether or not I wanted to read differed from
        time to time, but when I began to enjoy reading was at a young age. I loved books, and I loved reading for pleasure.
        Once I got into a book I enjoyed, I had to finish it by the same day I started it.</h5>

        <h5>sports as a hobby can be a sanctuary, a space of solace, and an escape from the relentless demands of work and life.
        It's an opportunity to clear the mind, to release stress, and to rejuvenate the spirit.I am a great fan of football. I used to practice this game since I knew how to. My parents and my coach
        encouraged me a lot to perform well in my favourite sport. I believe that it is a game that combines strategy,
        athleticism, and teamwork.</h5>
